I am Yuwen "Lucas" Tao(陶誉文). I am a junior at Shanghai Pinghe School. I love learning and thinking. Here are my experiences and interests.
- I love variety of things: Distributed Systems, AI, Computer Graphics, Parallel Programming, Competitive Programming. etc. I am still wondering what am I going to do in future. 
- I love research, but I like learning, coding and logics more than research. But what I like the most are anime and fantasy novels(玄幻小说).
